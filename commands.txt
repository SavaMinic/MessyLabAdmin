Lazy loading is not working, so you need to use .Include() inside controllers when fetching from model

Many-to-many is not working automatically in EF7, just make join table between those 2 entities.

dnvm install latest -r coreclr


Having more than one foreign key in EF7 RC1

modelBuilder.Entity("MessyLabAdmin.Models.Solution", b =>
{
	b.HasOne("MessyLabAdmin.Models.Assignment")
		.WithMany()
		.HasForeignKey("AssignmentID")
		.OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict); // MUST ADD THIS

	b.HasOne("MessyLabAdmin.Models.Student")
		.WithMany()
		.HasForeignKey("StudentID");
});

The short answer is that EF7 does not currently support automatic lazy loading in the same way that EF6 did.
 I've seen it discussed in a few places and if anyone is better informed feel free to correct me but as far as 
 I am aware it is fairly far down their priority list and if some posts I have read are to be believed, 
 that's if they choose to implement it at all.
